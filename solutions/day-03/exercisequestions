What are the files and folders inside a project folder(package.json,
package-lock.json or yarn.lock, .gitignore,node_modules and public)?
-package.json // contains metadata relevate to the project and used to manage
the project's dependencies, scripts, version, etc.
-package-lock.json // stores an exact versioned dependency tree rather than
using starred versioning like package.json.  Used to guarantee the dependencies for other
devs or prod releases.  Can lock this tree, but generally will regenerate if package.json
changes.
